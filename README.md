This represents the front end authentication (login and sign up) for the Firebase project.

INSTRUCTIONS TO GET STARTED:

1. Ensure that you have a code editor installed on your computer. I used VSCode.

2. Using the terminal navigate to a folder you would like to have all your files.

3. Create a config.js file based on the example-config.js file, and input your firebase configuration details.
